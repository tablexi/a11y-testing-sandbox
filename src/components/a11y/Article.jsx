        After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
        gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
        brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
        water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in
        Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
        Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
        her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
        together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to
        know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
        place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
        very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
        you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
        left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
        the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
        business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
        before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They
        will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
        who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."

        Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
        driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
        mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his
        mind was not very differently engaged.

        "There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
        pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
        me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
        during your stay at Lambton?"
